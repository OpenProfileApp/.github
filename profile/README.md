# Welcome to OpenProfile!
We are creating a collaborative cross-platform application for writers, producers, and role-players to share minds and create diverse characters using an immensely advanced and FREE character profile template. For fandoms and authors, we even have a public database in the works that would enable users to learn more about your characters and the universe that goes around them! 

OpenProfile was accidently created in 2017 and remained hardly developed and private until 2021 when it became an open-source project.
